Health information administrators can use this tool to build a "combo" of medications based on CancerCare Ontario PrePrinted Orders (PPOs), which allows end users like Oncologists/Hematologists and Nurse Practitioners to make chemotherapy regimen prescriptions and customize the combo of medications based on actual situation, for the patient to take to a pharmacy to dispense medications.
